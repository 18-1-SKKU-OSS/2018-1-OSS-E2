<How to pull request>
1. Always make your own branch, not the master branch, commit it, and then push it.

2. Obviously you should not do it often, and if you do, 
you will need a level of explanation that will be understandable over time

3. However, since all of this project is a beginner,
you can freely express it. You can ignore all the codes of conduct if you are learning in them.

4. If anyone wanna add,edit or delete these things, help yourself!
